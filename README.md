# WordSearch

This project was created in September of 2020

Word searches create two interesting, and closely related, challenges. I developed this project to solve the problems that are posed by word searches. 

The first is when given a 2d grid of characters and a specific string, my word search determines whether or not the string is present, and if so reports not only the location, but direction at which the word can be found. 

Second, when given a target size, and a list of words, my word search project will generate a pseudo-random 2d grid of characters such that all (or most) of the given words can be found in the generated grid.
